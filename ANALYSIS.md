# Prototype Evaluation

This initial prototype implements the core vision from the README:

- Static `index.html` with no backend
- Master password decrypts an AES-encrypted vault
- Decrypted secrets feed otplib to display rotating TOTP codes

## Strengths

- **Self-contained**: Runs entirely in the browser without server dependencies.
- **Encryption at rest**: Secrets stored as an AES-encrypted blob.
- **Standards compliant**: Uses otplib for RFC 6238 TOTP generation.
- **Simple UI**: Minimal layout focused on security prompt and code list.

## Challenges

- **Password security**: Single passphrase with no strength checking or key stretching.
- **Vault management**: Encrypted vault string is embedded in HTML with no edit or import UI.
- **Error feedback**: Lacks detailed messaging for failed decryption or malformed vaults.
- **No persistence**: Secrets disappear on reload unless the HTML is manually updated.

## Toward an Alpha Version

A more mature alpha could target:

1. **Vault import/export** workflow with a dedicated encrypt/decrypt helper.
2. **PBKDF2 or scrypt** key derivation to slow brute-force attempts.
3. **LocalStorage integration** so the encrypted blob can be stored and updated in-browser.
4. **Responsive UI** with countdown timers, accessibility features, and mobile-friendly layout.
5. **Error handling & validation** to guide users on incorrect passwords or corrupt data.
6. **Optional offline bundle** packaging CDN libraries locally for airâ€‘gapped use.

These steps would move the project from proof-of-concept to a functional alpha ready for broader testing.
